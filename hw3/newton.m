function F = newton(x,y,xbar,n)
% Computer code for evaluating the Newton polynomial based on a set of
% given points and degree
% Input:  x    --- Sample x points for evaluating polynomial
%         y    --- Sample y points for evaluating polynomial
%         xbar --- Point we want to evaluate at
%         n    --- degree of Newton polynomial
